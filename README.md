# Search-Engine

**NOTE**: inside your project folder you have to create a data folder which contains the .txt files for your index.

Using the data pool I created with the scrapping bot from wikipedia articles for movies, I implemented a seach engine using Lucene Library, which searches the index to match a given word with the title or the conent of one or more movies. User can choose the fields he wants to search in. The results are given as an html file containing a list of results sorted by relevance according to Lucene and embedings measurements. Please feel free to contact me for more info. For that project I was awarded with the heighest mark of the whole class of 2015 for the Subject Information Retrieval of the University of Ioannina.
